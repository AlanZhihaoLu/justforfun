            <h1>About</h1>
            <p> 
                I will preface by saying that I have absolutely no training in matters of art, art history, or philosophy. 
                I’m just someone with a knack for impractical thought exercises.
            </p>
            <p>
                Recently, I had been thinking about the roles of art and artist. 
                My first thoughts on art conjured up images of Renaissance-era paintings and sculptures.
                Art pieces from that era seemed to have been defined by strict and almost scientific adherence to realism. 
                Thus, I formed the initial basis that perhaps art is (1) realistic and (2) pleasing to the eye and to the mind.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, soon afterwards, I thought about how some art could be grotesque and terrifying, and how other art could be non-realistic and abstract.
                Quickly, then, my basis of art understanding crumbled.
                First, I realized that art did not have any specific physical quality.
                Second, I realized that the experience of art did not have to be pleasant.
                Therefore, art was something (unbound by physical characteristics) that evoked something (unbound by experiential characteristics) in the viewer.
                I concluded that the viewer was the critical element, and that art could not have existed unless it was viewed. 
                I use the term ‘viewer’ loosely to mean any person who might experience art.
                The experience did not have to be visual: it could be auditory, tactile, olfactory, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my mind, then, there were three parties that began taking shape: the art, the artist, and the viewer.
            </p>
            <p>
                I turned my attention next to the artist. 
                What differentiated the artist from the viewer? 
                Common definition suggested that the artist is the creator of the art.
                They are the one who painted the painting, the one who sculpted the sculpture.
                Yet, what did it mean to create?
                Did creation have to be physical?
            </p>
            <p>
                The most interesting thought that has been put in my head in the past few years has been whether reality is material. 
                Putting aside my lengthy and likely naïve perspective on subjective idealism, I have become convinced in some way that perception is creation.
                When I view an object, say, a chair, a copy of the chair is created in my mind.
                The mental chair copy does not reflect the essence of the chair. 
                The essence of the chair is amorphous and is betrayed by how the chair shifts and transforms at different angles and luminance.
                The mental chair copy, however, is static – it is a still shot of the amorphous thing that is pinned down by subjective perception.
                In other words, perception changes the nature of the amorphous thing and creates something new.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, I reset from the metaphysical and return my focus to the artist.
                It could be said that the artist is simply the first viewer: the first to perceive.
                The artist was the one who perceived the figure in the marble. 
                The act of sculpting the figure merely gave form to that vision.
                Therefore, I propose that the sculptor is separate from the artist.
            </p>
            <p>
                I draw inspiration from Marcel Duchamp and his readymades. 
                Duchamp took ordinary objects and elevated them to the significance of art by moving them about, giving them titles, and signing them. 
                The art was not manufactured by Duchamp. 
                Yet, Duchamp is the artist because he was the first to perceive the object as art.
            </p>
            <p>
                To summarize: (1) art is defined not by construction but by perception, and (2) the artist is the first viewer and the first to perceive. 
                I decided to test these conclusions, on you.
            </p>
            <p>
                First, I had to separate the sculptor from the artist. 
                I wrote a simple script that would instruct the computer to draw random elements on a blank canvas.
                Decisions on what, where, how, and how many elements were all randomized.
                The computer blindly followed the script, and the script was randomly generated. 
                Neither the computer nor the script could have perceived, so neither of them could have been the artist.
            </p>
            <p>
                Second, I had to demonstrate that the art and the artist both were made from the first perception. 
                The instant you opened that webpage, the script was randomized, and the elements were drawn on the canvas. 
                The canvas was meaningless elements that were untainted by interpretation.
                The purity of the canvas was important. 
                The viewer appreciates the art because it was first perceived and elevated by the artist.
                To be considered an artist in the purest form, then, required the art to be previously unperceived. 
                From its inception, that canvas was only shown to you.
                Until you saw it, there was neither art nor artist.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, I must ask: are you the artist<span id="interpretation"></span>?
